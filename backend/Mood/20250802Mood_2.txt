Input Mood: I submitted my thesis today after 3 years of work. It feels surreal that this chapter is finally closing.

basic_emotions:
- joy: intensity=4, reason="It sounds like you're really celebrating a huge accomplishment! That's wonderful to hear, and it's totally okay to feel so happy after such a long journey."
- sadness: intensity=3, reason="You mentioned it feels surreal that this chapter is closing, which makes sense â€“ it's natural to feel a little bittersweet when something significant ends after so much dedication."
