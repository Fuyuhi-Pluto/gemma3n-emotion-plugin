Input Mood: I'm graduating next week. I'm so proud but really going to miss this place.

Okay, I'm ready to analyze the text and offer a supportive response.

basic_emotions:
- joy: intensity=4, reason="You mentioned feeling proud, and that's wonderful! It sounds like you've worked so hard and achieved something truly special."
- sadness: intensity=3, reason="You also said you're going to miss the place, and that's completely understandable. It's natural to feel a sense of loss when something significant comes to an end."
- anticipation: intensity=2, reason="Thinking about the future and what's next is exciting! It sounds like you're looking forward to the possibilities ahead."

companion_response:
What a mix of feelings! It's such a big step, and it's completely okay to feel both proud and a little sad. What are you most looking forward to about the future?
